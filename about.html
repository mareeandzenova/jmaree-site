     I help people reconnect with themselves through clarity, storytelling, and practices that center emotional and creative intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve worn a few hats: yoga teacher, community health coach, brand storyteller, and a lifelong student of what makes life feel meaningful.
  </p>

  <p>
    Across each chapter, one thing stayed consistent: people don’t need more noise.
    They need space. Space to feel. Space to reflect. Space to hear themselves clearly.

  <h2>My Approach</h2>

  <p>
    My work isn’t about fixing or optimizing you. It’s about creating thoughtful
    conditions for reconnection through storytelling, voice, ritual, and attention.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether through personal practices or creative collaboration, I focus on clarity,
    emotional intelligence, and grounded presence.
