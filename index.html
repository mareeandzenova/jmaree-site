  <h1>Your Favorite Failed Yogi</h1>
  <p>Hi, I’m J. Maree—yoga teacher turned wellness storyteller. I spent years guiding communities and exploring health practices, only to realize: the lessons that stick are the ones that come from imperfection.</p>

  <p>Now, I share real-life wellness, ritual, and care practices that actually fit into the chaos of life. Think of me as your guide for soulful routines, honest reflections, and moments that help you feel seen, softened, and returned to yourself—without the Instagram-perfect pressure.</p>

  <p>Because sometimes, failing at something you love teaches you more than mastering it ever could.</p>

  <h2>The Goal of the Failed Yogi</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Normalize imperfection:</strong> Pursue wellness and growth without needing to be “perfect.”</li>
    <li><strong>Humanize expertise:</strong> Share lived experience, trial and error, and real struggles.</li>
    <li><strong>Inspire action:</strong> Show that trying, failing, and learning is part of the journey.</li>
    <li><strong>Bridge wellness and storytelling:</strong> Teach yoga, health, rituals, and habits through real-life narrative and humor.</li>
    <li><strong>Build community:</strong> Candor about missteps cultivates followers who value honesty over perfection.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This isn’t about being a flawless yogi. It’s about being an authentic guide for anyone navigating life’s messy, transitional, or self-improvement moments.</p>
